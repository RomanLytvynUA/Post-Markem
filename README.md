## Description
<b>Post-Markem</b> is a tool that enables you to perform a Post-Mortem of adjudicators' marks.

In Ballroom/Latin dancing competitions, results are purely subjective. Adjudicators decide whether competitors get recalled or what place they take purely based on their personal impression. This process cannot be automated in order to respect the artistic aspect of dancing. However, this makes it difficult to hold adjudicators accountable, since something that looks like bias can easily be justified as a "personal view".

That said, provided that we have enough statistics and data to operate on, the vast majority of bias can be highlighted. The app aims to analyze the marks in order to assemble structured feedback on an adjudicator and hopefully make allegations of bribery either evident or refuted.

## Features

- [x] <b>Protocol parser</b> - module that ingests a competition protocol and presents the data in a format processable by the analyzers.
- [ ] <b>Maverick Score</b> - a deviation metric that quantifies how frequently an adjudicator's marks contradict the final calculated result (The "Accuracy" delta).
- [ ] <b>Weighted Simulation</b> - a "What If" engine that recalculates the results by applying a reliability weight to each adjudicator's vote.
- [ ] <b>Bias Detector</b> - a directional metric that identifies when an adjudicator consistently marks a specific competitor significantly higher than the panel average.
- [ ] <b>Trust Leaderboard</b> - a global ranking of adjudicators based on their cumulative impartiality and consistency scores across multiple events.
- [ ] <b>Coalition Scanner</b> – a correlation matrix that detects "Block Voting" by identifying pairs of adjudicators with statistically improbable agreement rates.
